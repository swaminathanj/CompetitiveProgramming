# Design Patterns

Regardless of the kind of software you develop in object oriented setting, be it a web application, android app or system software, there are some common patterns of problems that arise repeatedly. Each design pattern aims to provide a general solution to a these problems.

Design patterns can be broadly classified into three types.
  - Structural - Relates to structuring or organizing data
  - Behavioral - Relates to communication between objects 
  - Creational - Relates to object creation
  
# 1. Strategy pattern

## Type: Behavioral

## Definition (from Head First Design Patterns)
  - Stategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable.
  - Strategy lets the algorithm be very independently from the clients that use it.

## Underlying principle
  - Use composition over inheritance to achive better flexibility.
